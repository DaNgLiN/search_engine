'''Donald John Trump''' ([[:File:Donald John Trump.oga|standard pronunciation]]; born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman, politician, television personality, author, and the [[presumptive nominee]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO NOMINEE UNTIL AFTER THE CONVENTION --> of the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican Party]] for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].  He is chairman of [[The Trump Organization]], which is the principal [[holding company]] for his real estate ventures and other business interests.

Trump worked for [[Fred Trump|his father's]] real estate development firm while attending college. After graduating from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] in 1968, he joined the company and in 1971 was given control, later renaming it The Trump Organization. He has since built casinos, golf courses, hotels, [[Riverside South, Manhattan|a New York City neighborhood]], and other real estate properties, [[List of things named after Donald Trump|many of which bear his name]], and founded [[Trump Entertainment Resorts]] (now owned by [[Carl Icahn]]).  He has also made [[personal branding|branding]] deals that feature his name on properties in which he has minority or no ownership.  Listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' as one of [[The World's Billionaires|the world's wealthiest people]], Trump and his businesses, as well as his three marriages, have received prominent media exposure. He hosted ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', a popular [[NBC]] [[reality television]] show, from 2004 to 2015.

Trump first [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000|campaigned for the U.S. presidency in 2000]], and withdrew before any votes were cast, but still won two [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] primaries. On June 16, 2015, he again announced his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|candidacy]] for president, as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Trump became known for supporting measures to reduce [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], for opposing various [[Free trade|free-trade agreements]] that he regards as unfair, for his frequently [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] views on foreign policy, and for his idea to temporarily ban most foreign [[Muslim]]s from entering the United States until [[United States Congress|Congress]] can determine how to address [[Islamic terrorism]]. Trump quickly emerged as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. His remarks and positions have inspired [[Protests of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|protests]] both opposing and supporting him.

Trump's victories—culminating with the [[Indiana Republican primary, 2016|Indiana primary]]—led his remaining Republican rivals to suspend their campaigns, whereupon Republican chairman [[Reince Priebus]] declared Trump the party's presumptive presidential nominee. A few weeks later, on May 26, 2016, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Trump had gained the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination.

Trump promoted Penn Central's rail yard on [[30th Street (Manhattan)|30th Street]] as a site for New York City's planned [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]].

Repairs on the [[Wollman Rink]] in [[Central Park]], built in 1955, were started in 1980 by a [[general contractor]] unconnected to Trump, with an expected {{frac|2|1|2}}-year construction schedule, but were not completed by 1986.

Any such analysis is difficult because, as the newspaper observed, "Information about Mr Trump’s business is sketchy. He doesn't run a publicly listed firm..."

Its sister property, [[Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino]], closed in September 2014. In November 2014, the Trump Taj Mahal threatened to close and cease casino and hotel operations by the end of the year if the union would not drop its appeal of the casino's bankruptcy ruling, rebuffing their demand for continued health insurance and pension coverage. On December 18, 2014 the Trump Taj Mahal reached an agreement with its union and kept the casino open, but did not restore the contested benefits.

=== Net worth ===
Trump has claimed that his net worth is over ten billion dollars, whereas in 2015 ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth at 4.5 billion, and ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'' estimated it at 2.9 billion, with the discrepancies due in part to the uncertainty of appraised property values.<ref>Cassidy, John.

The Forbes figure was high enough to put Trump in a tie at No. 324 on the magazine’s global ranking of billionaires....The gap between Forbes’s $4.5 billion figure and Bloomberg’s $2.9 billion figure is largely attributable to differences in how the two publications appraised individual properties."</ref>  These estimates would make Trump one of the [[List of richest American politicians|richest politicians in American history]].

=== Investments ===
According to a July 2015 press release by Trump's campaign, a portion of Trump's fortune is held in assets outside his holdings in The Trump Organization, most of which are concentrated in the financial market. In 2011, Trump made a rare foray into the stock market after being disappointed with the depressed American real estate market and facing poor returns on [[Certificate of deposit|bank deposits]]. He stated that he was not a stock market person, but he also stated that prime real estate at good prices is hard to get. Among the stocks Trump purchased, he stated he bought stock in [[Bank of America]], [[Citigroup]], [[Caterpillar Inc.]], [[Intel]], [[Johnson & Johnson]] and [[Procter & Gamble]].<ref name="Jeff Cox">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/44102433 |title=Trump Changes Gears, Now Buying Bluechip Stocks |publisher=CNBC |date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |author=Jeff Cox}}</ref> In December 2012, Trump revealed that he also added shares of [[Facebook]] to his stock portfolio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/1040381-why-i-would-buy-one-of-donald-trump-s-favorite-stocks-and-sell-the-other |title=Why I Would Buy One Of Donald Trump's Favorite Stocks And Sell The Other |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |author=Hawkinvest}}</ref> Trump also has US$9 million invested in hedge funds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/executive/donald-trump-is-rich-but-is-he-really-rich-we-break-it-down |title=Donald Trump is rich, but is he ‘really rich?’ |publisher=Financial Post |date=July 17, 2015 |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Brownell, Claire}}</ref> He earned US$6.7 million from selling shares in Bank of America and an additional US$3.9 million from selling Facebook in 2014.<ref name="auto4"/>

=== Sports ===
In 1983, Trump purchased the [[New Jersey Generals]] for the inaugural season of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL). The Generals hired former [[New York Jets]] head coach [[Walt Michaels]]. Before the inaugural season began, Trump sold the franchise to [[Oklahoma]] oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. Then, prior to the 1984 season, Duncan sold the team back to Trump.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/04/sports/sports-people-new-jersey-generalities.html |title=Sports People; New Jersey Generalities |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=April 4, 1984 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

[[File:Donald trump at the game (3728975319).jpg|thumb|left|Trump at a baseball game in 2009]]The USFL played its first 1983, 1984, and 1985 seasons during the summer. Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite the [[National Football League]] (NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL; owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment increase significantly.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/and-then-there-was-the-time-donald-trump-bought-a-football-team-/2015/10/19/35ae71ca-6dd6-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html |title=And then there was the time Donald Trump bought a football team |publisher=The Washington Post |date=October 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 17, 2016 |author=Terris, Ben}}</ref>

The Generals merged with the [[Houston Gamblers]] during the extended offseason prior to the fall of 1986, adding such stars as quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] and wide receiver [[Ricky Sanders]]. Michaels was fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach [[Jack Pardee]], who planned to bring the Gamblers' high-powered [[run and shoot offense]] with him. However, the USFL's "Dream Team" never took the field. The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won a minimal verdict (of less than four dollars) in an [[antitrust]] [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|lawsuit against the NFL]]; the USFL folded soon afterward.

Trump at one time acted as a financial advisor for [[Mike Tyson]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/sports/sports-of-the-times-trump-promoter-or-adviser.html |title=Sports of The Times; Trump: Promoter Or Adviser? |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=July 12, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Anderson, Dave}}</ref> hosting [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks|Tyson's 1988 fight]] against [[Michael Spinks]] in Atlantic City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/sports/trump-gets-tyson-fight.html |title=Trump Gets Tyson Fight |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |date=February 25, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

From 1996 until 2015, when he sold his interests,<ref name=pageantsaleWME>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/business/media/trump-sells-miss-universe-organization-to-wme-img-talent-agency.html |title=Trump Sells Miss Universe Organization to WME-IMG Talent Agency |date=September 15, 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 9, 2016}}</ref> Trump owned part or all of the [[Miss Universe]], [[Miss USA]], and [[Miss Teen USA]] [[beauty pageant]]s. Among the most recognized beauty pageants in the world, the Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by the California clothing company Pacific Mills.<ref>{{cite news|title=Donald Trump just sold off the entire Miss Universe Organization|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-sells-miss-universe-img-2015-9|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref>

In 2002, Trump was dissatisfied with how [[CBS]] scheduled his pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to [[NBC]], where the shows thrived.  In 2006, Miss USA winner [[Tara Conner]] tested positive for cocaine, but Trump let her keep the crown, for the sake of giving her a second chance.  That decision by Trump was criticized by [[Rosie O'Donnell]], which led to a very blunt and personal rebuttal by Trump criticizing O'Donnell.  In 2012, Trump won a $5 million court award against a contestant who claimed the show was rigged.<ref>Kirkpatrick, Nick and Moyer, Justin.

In 2015, NBC and [[Univision]] both ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization after Trump's presidential campaign kickoff speech on June 16, in which he said about Mexico: "They’re sending people that have a lot of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."<ref name=Tadena1>{{cite web |author=Natalie Tadena |date=July 2, 2015 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/07/02/donald-trumps-miss-usa-pageant-lands-on-reelz-cable-channel/ |title=Donald Trump's Miss USA Pageant Lands on Reelz Cable Channel |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/ "Full text: Donald Trump announces a presidential bid"], ''[[Washington Post]]'' (June 16, 2015).</ref>

Trump subsequently filed a $500 million lawsuit against Univision, alleging a breach of contract and defamation. In his statement about the lawsuit against Univision, Trump said, "Nothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years. I want strong borders, and I do not support or condone illegal immigration. There is a high level of crime occurring in this country due to unchecked illegal immigration.

In 2003, Trump became the [[executive producer]] and host of the [[NBC]] [[Reality series|reality show]] ''The Apprentice'', in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises.
